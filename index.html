        <p><span>Danny DeVito.</span></p>
        <p><span>We all know him as the loud, short, wise-cracker with an unmistakable accent from movies such as "Wise Guys", "Twins", or shows like "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."</span></p>
        <p><span>He's brought joy to countless people's lives over his 50+ year career, showing them the meaning of laughter and mirth.</span></p>
        <p><span>But how much do you, dear reader, really know about him? To you, he may seem more akin to a puzzle; an enigma of a man, a conundrum waiting to be solved.
            How on earth could one man, being so small of body, bring so much into the world?
        </span></p>
        <p><span>If you find yourself in this state, dear reader, you are in luck! For this site's very existence is dedicated to introducing this paradox of a human being.</span></p>
        <p><span>Within this site, you will find several pages dedicated to the different facets of our mystery man: his life story, filmography, a curated collection of images, and
            even an interface that mimics the real man himself! Feel free to peruse them in any order, though take care that you do not rush the experience. Soak it all in, one beautiful piece at a time.
        </span></p>
        <p><span>Enjoy the journey, O Reader.</span></p>
