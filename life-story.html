                <div class="accordion-body"><p>Before any creature roamed the cosmos, life wandered the universe. Beyond thought, beyond comprehension, microbes existed alone. They floated, meandered throughout space.
                    Ever watching, ever looking for a planet to call their own, one where they could evolve and transform into something greater. Something at the pinnacle of all existence.
                    </p>
                    <p>After countless measures of time, these infinitesimal beginnings of life found a curiously colored sphere among the rest - it was clothed in blues and greens, and teemed
                        with more life than their microscopic eyes had ever seen before. Thus, the microbes decided to enter this "Earth", and determine whether this was indeed to be their final
                        resting place.
                    </p>
                    <p>The microbes were surprised beyond belief at what they saw. On Earth they found culture, love, war, life, and death. They found creatures of all forms and number of legs,
                        forms that journeyed throughout the waters, and forms that lived their entire lives in open air. Never before had they beheld such diversity of flesh. And so, without much
                        further thought, the microbes decided that this would be their home. Here, in the year "1944", they would establish a life-form that would be above the rest in every way.
                        A giant among men. A titan of goodwill, joy, and power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the microbes swirled together, their fractals billowing and surging, a body began to form. The microbes modeled it after the race Earth called "human", for it seemed
                        to be the dominant life-form. The microbes impressed upon it their desire for the body to become strong, to become larger than any other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But then, they stopped. For if they were to continue, what would be the consequence? Were they to create a being that would become a god, one that would inevitably worshipped?
                        Or would they create a monster, one that would only see pain and torment for the rest of its life? For the microbes had seen the pain that existed on Earth. The hatred, the disdain
                        for anything greater or more powerful than humanity. Here, it was kill or be killed. And if the microbes were to create such a powerful creature, they might be dooming it to a life
                        that wasn't a life at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so, the microbes changed course. They gave their creation a body that was not larger than any man, but much smaller. One that would appear harmless, one that would even inspire mirth
                        in the hearts of other men. Not a spirit of mockery, but of pure joy. Next, they gave their creation a heart larger than that of a normal man's. Not a heart physically larger, nay, but
                        one that was capable of holding more joy and laughter than any other. One that would tear down boundaries, would erase all the prejudices and hatred that humanity had built up against each other
                        over millenia. This creature would unite them all. It would save them all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the microbes put the finishing touches on their creation, their consciousness started to slip away, as expected. In mere moments, they would be absorbed into their creation, not remembering
                        the time they spent alone in the cosmos, untouched by any other matter. Gone would be the infinite knowledge of the universe. They would, in essence, become this new human, with no knowledge of
                        their former life. The reverted their creation to a low-level human, deciding to be birthed as all other forms are on Earth, from the womb of a woman. The microbes decided to be born in an area
                        called "New Jersey", the pinnacle of all creation in their mind. With this last act, the microbes faded away. They left behind one emotion, one lingering feeling that they hoped to impress greatly
                        upon their creation:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Happiness.

                  <p>DeVito played Martini in the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, reprising his role from the 1971 off-Broadway play of the same title.</p>

                  <p>After his time on the Taxi series ended, DeVito devoted more effort to a growing successful film career, appearing as Vernon Dalhart in the 1983 hit

                    and the film adaptation Matilda (1996), which he directed and co-produced, along with playing the role of Matilda's father, the villainous car dealer
                    Harry Wormwood.</p>

                  <p>Although generally a comic actor, DeVito expanded into dramatic roles with The Rainmaker (1997); Hoffa (1992), which he directed and in which he co-starred
                    with Jack Nicholson; Jack the Bear (1993); neo-noir film L.A. Confidential (1997); The Big Kahuna (1999); and Heist (2001), as a gangster nemesis of Joe Moore

                  <p>DeVito has an interest in documentaries. In 2006 he began a partnership with Morgan Freeman's company ClickStar, for whom he hosts the documentary channel
                    Jersey Docs. He was also interviewed in the documentary Revenge of the Electric Car, discussing his interest in and ownership of electric vehicles.</p>

                    cast of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia as Frank Reynolds.</p>

                  <p>In 2011, DeVito received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in television. In 2012, he voiced the title character in the animated version of
                    Dr. Seuss's The Lorax. In 2013, along with Rashida Jones, he voiced Herb for the third time on "The Changing of the Guardian" episode of The Simpsons
                    (aired January 27, 2013). He appeared in the Angry Birds Friends "Champions for Earth" tournament advertisement in September 2015. Following the
                    Japanese release of the Nintendo 3DS game Detective Pikachu, dedicated Pokémon fans submitted a 40,000-signature petition requesting that DeVito be the
                    English voice actor for the title character. However, he declined to audition for the role, commenting that he was unfamiliar with the franchise.</p></div>

                  <p>DeVito stands 4 feet 10 inches (1.47 metres) tall. His short stature is the result of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia
                  (Fairbank's disease), a rare genetic disorder that affects bone growth.</p>

                  <p>On January 17, 1971, DeVito met Rhea Perlman when she went to see a friend in the single performance of the play The Shrinking Bride, which featured DeVito.
                    They moved in together two weeks later and married on January 28, 1982. They have three children: Lucy Chet DeVito (born March 11, 1983), Grace Fan DeVito
                    (born March 1985), and Jacob Daniel DeVito (born October 1987).</p>

                  <p>Perlman and DeVito have acted alongside each other several times, including in the television show Taxi and the feature film Matilda (where they played Matilda's parents).
                    They separated in October 2012, after 30 years of marriage and over 40 years together, then reconciled in March 2013. They separated for a second time in March 2017, but
                    remained on amicable terms and Perlman stated they had no intent of filing for divorce. In 2019, Perlman told interviewer Andy Cohen that she and DeVito have become closer
                    friends after their separation than they were in their final years as a couple.</p>

                  <p>DeVito and Perlman resided in a 14,579-square-foot (1,354 m2) house in Beverly Hills, California, that they purchased in 1994, until selling it for US$24 million in April 2015.
                    They also own a bungalow near Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, and a multi-residence compound on Broad Beach in Malibu.</p>

                  <p>DeVito and Perlman are members of the steering committee of the Friends of the Apollo, supporting a theater in Oberlin, Ohio, as was filmmaker Jonathan Demme. DeVito
                    co-owned a restaurant called DeVito South Beach in Miami Beach, Florida, which closed in 2011. Politically, DeVito is a Democrat and a staunch supporter of Bernie Sanders.</p></div>
